invoice-auditor-ai is an intelligent financial audit automation solution. Moving beyond traditional OCR, this project leverages Advanced AI to "comprehend" and validate invoice content autonomously.

Key Features:
Multimodal Data Extraction: Analyzes both structured data (prices, dates, tax IDs) and unstructured information from PDF or image-based invoices.

Compliance Auditing: Automatically verifies if invoices adhere to business regulations and tax requirements.

Anomaly Detection: Identifies potential duplicates, inflated amounts, or fraudulent patterns through historical data comparison.

Automated Reporting: Generates comprehensive summaries regarding the validity and status of financial documents.
